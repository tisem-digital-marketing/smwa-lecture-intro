# Textbooks, Readings

* **No Textbook** for the class
  * Become outdated fast as social media changes rapidly
  * Some emphasise too much of the hype, remainder are too dry
  * I do like Aral's *'Hype Machine'* though ... but its audience is not quite this class

* **My job**: filter through the sea of information and teach what is useful and relevant
  * No hype, hopefully not too dry

* **Your job**: read over assigned papers, learn the skills
  * I've curated course content to (hopefully) deliver the most insight with the least technical details
  * Readings shouldn't be 'hype', occasionally dry
  * Coding skills acquired should be easy to transfer to a different problem

* Lecture slides will be on course website as PDFs

class: font150

# Coding, Maths and Stats

This is an **analytics** class (it's even in the course name!)

* We will develop an analytics toolkit
  * Mainly 'code based', occasionally we'll need some maths and stats
    * ... I've tried to minimise unnecessary maths / stats

* Coding backgrounds among students is heterogeneous
  * Principle: Leave no-one behind
    * Instructors are here to help catch you up and provide further guidance as needed
    * $\implies$ work with us, even when it is hard
    * Be willing to learn from each other, form study groups, use the Slack chat etc

... More on coding stuff *later*

class: font140

# Things to Keep in Mind

* This course is **quite new**
  * We look at **current** state of the art knowledge
  * There will likely be bugs ...
  * ... We'll work through them together

* Mix of students at various levels, from various backgrounds
  * Learn from other's unique perspectives

* I (awkwardly) straddle the line between marketing & economics
  * I care about 'mechanisms' and explaining why things happen
  * I care about more than only the 4P's
  * I'm not a 'data scientist' or computer scientist
  * $\implies$ pragmatism towards analysis that asks interesting questions

# Lachlan: Areas of Expertise

Why is all this relevant?

* I've used social media data throughout my career
  * From constructing simple tables and figures to convince firms to update their decisions and strategies
  * ... to quite elaborate statistical / econometric models
      * that appeal to other academics
  
**I believe in the value of what I am teaching**

# Social Media Analytics: <br> A possibly biased perspective

---
class: font180

# What is Social Media Analytics?

Social Media Analytics is the application of statistical methods to understand behaviour on social media websites to make business decisions

* It's generally *empirical*, sometimes theoretical (i.e. mathematical)

**What kinds of empirical analysis are of interest to us as marketers?**

* Descriptive Analysis
* Causal Analysis
* Predictive Analysis

---
class: font160

# Descriptive Analysis

**Descriptive Analysis**: summarise characteristics of a data set

* What does the data look like?
  * Means, standard deviations distribution of data
  * Results are (stylised) *facts*

Examples:

* How are users who discuss the US election connected on Twitter?
* What topics are discussed on Yelp Reviews? 
* Are discussions on Reddit about Albert Heijn different from those on Twitter?

---
class: font160

# Causal Analysis

**Causal Analysis**: Does A lead to B?
  * Might also care about the mechanism of how it happens

Examples:

* Do Facebook ads increase product purchases?
* Does product adoption by influencers increase demand?
* Do tweets by TV studios increase the number of viewers of their show?

---
class: font160

# Predictive Analysis

**Predictive Analysis**: How can I best predict an outcome?
  * When A occurs, so does B

Examples:

* Is this review posted by a real person or by a bot?
* How many retweets does Nike expect its next tweet to get?
* Who is a new Twitter user likely to follow?

---
class: font160

# How to do Social Media Analytics

Social Media Analytics needs to combine tools from three areas:

1. Network Analytics
2. Text Analytics - 'Text-as-data'
3. Statistical / Econometric Methods

The exact mix of these depends on:

* The question you want to answer 
  * Example: Can one deliver valuable insight by ignoring the network structure?
* Personal taste
  * ... I've increasingly started to value the network side of things lately
  * ... This view is not necessarily representative of all marketers 

---
class: font160

# Good and Bad News ...

**Good news**: high quality social media analytics is incredibly useful

Why?

* Social media impacts a wide variety of industries
  * Media & entertainment, politics, health care, FMCG, fashion & beauty, etc
* It provides real answers to real problems in marketing and business strategy
  * And *people care about the answers*

* Being able to do (good) social media analytics ensures many (enjoyable) job prospects

---
class: font180

# Good and Bad News ...

**Bad News**: Its *hard*

* One needs to learn about networks, text analysis *and* statistics
* ... **and** be able to work on causal and predictive questions

(That seems like *a lot*...)

* And... learning the tools can be boring

**_Opinion_**: I think the upside far, far outweighs the bad.
